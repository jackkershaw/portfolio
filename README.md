# My Portfolio

- Bootstrapped with React + Vite
- Imported the Html and Css from [my old portfolio](https://github.com/jones58/portfolio), this involved splitting the HTML into JSX files for React. This was one of the main reasons for switching to React - being able to have easily editable components like the footer and header, rather than repeating them on every page.
- Changed the colour scheme to reflect my favourite blue (#002FA7)
- Used events to add js inside jsx for the dark mode toggle.
- Used useState to
- Edited color scheme within tailwind.config.js.

##Â TODO:

- change design

  - look through inspo/sites i like like fourtet site.
  - redesign it as wireframe
  - fix css, making it better with React and Tailwind.

- Finish fireship tutorials react .
- see nextcloud todo list for next steps on learning react and finishing portfolio.
- use scrolltotop function instead of navbar thing.
- add dark mode and other js features back in - will have to learn about state i think.
- use livesurface to make mockups for portfolio
