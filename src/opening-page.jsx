        Hi there! I'm Jack, a London-based designer and developer. I've spent
        the past year and a half learning the fundamentals of development,
        including taking part in Just IT's highly selective twelve-week
        bootcamp. So far I've learnt HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, React and
        Tailwind CSS.
