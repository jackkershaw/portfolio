I've been meaning to write a blog for some time now. I quit most social media about three years ago and since then have come to rely on RSS from various news sites and blogs to stay up to date on the news, world politics and culture. It's refreshing to be away from the [Twittering Machine](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/2505-the-twittering-machine) but sometimes I miss the ability to share content with others, quickly and online.

I have a few ideas of where I want to go with this blog. In particular, I'd like to write about some thoughts on open-source software, the RSS protocol and web design. Watch this space!

If you want to subscribe via RSS, you can do so [here](https://jackkershaw.net/rss.xml).

Thanks to [Alex](https://alexworradandrews.com) for the push to get started with this.
