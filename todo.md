## New colour scheme

Moved to a more neutral colour scheme with ykb blue just used for accents rather than the whole site.

bg-neutral-300 text-neutral-900 dark:bg-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-300

set hover:text-ykb

## Coding

- redo the design of this page to be something [like this](https://www.emnuel.xyz/)
- Fix layout so don't have to scroll down so much
- Each project opens own page - like with design page, use a component layout to get it consistent.
- add a little bit about what new things you learnt or what was challenging for each project - make it a mini version of readme in github tbh.
- For the coding projects include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
- update portfolio images - maybe use puppeteer to get this done dynamically.

## Sitewide

- Add some animations! Look into cool things to do with Astro transitions etc.
  - framer motion or gsap too
  - css animations site that used with daily challenges site.
- Use Dribble, and other inspiration sites to copy good design
- Unprofessional, needs to be polished
- check site design across mobile.

some portfolio examples for inspiration: https://www.are.na/jack-kershaw/portfolio-khzymlhkihk

## Design

- Lay out each design on a page when click on it.
- For the design work include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
- Use as inspo to improve how design page looks: [Pentagram](https://www.pentagram.com/) and [MOMA](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5657s)
- pelicula - present like this: https://tosche.net/fonts/dossier

## Accessibility

- use audit thing in dev environment , make edits it suggests particularly for accessibility.
- use lighthouse and make suggested edits.
- Make clickable bits of header accessible on keyboard: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Keyboard?utm_source=devtools&utm_medium=a11y-panel-checks-keyboard#clickable_elements_must_be_focusable_and_should_have_interactive_semantics
