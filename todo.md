# To do list

Use traditional design structure - Material Design

Header - 3 to 5 options

Use Dribble, and other inspiration sites to copy good design

Color scheme - add a secondary colour

Fix layout, stuff overlapping
Have to scroll down

Footer shouldnt be sticky

Pdf not right size, needs to be more on view

Unprofessional, needs to be polished

put contact form and cv somewhere else

## Header

- mobile header should look like this [top app](https://m3.material.io/components/top-app-bar/overview)
- Add iconify icons for hamburger and cross

- remember to keep looking through examples you like

## Design

- Lay out each design on a page when click on it.
  - use a component layout to get it consistent.
  - can just make 10 subpages rather than building something more dynamic with local api etc.
- For the design work include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
- Use as inspo to improve how design page looks: [Pentagram](https://www.pentagram.com/)
- pelicula - present like this: https://tosche.net/fonts/dossier

## Blog

- see ideas in [drafts folder](src/pages/blog/_drafts)
- improve design on different screens and lining things up.

## Accessibility

- use audit thing in dev environment , make edits it suggests particularly for accessibility.
- use lighthouse and make suggested edits.
- Make clickable bits of header accessible on keyboard: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Keyboard?utm_source=devtools&utm_medium=a11y-panel-checks-keyboard#clickable_elements_must_be_focusable_and_should_have_interactive_semantics

## Coding page

- Each project opens own page - like with design page, use a component layout to get it consistent.
- add a little bit about what new things you learnt or what was challenging for each project - make it a mini version of readme in github tbh.
- For the coding projects include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
- update portfolio images - maybe use puppeteer to get this done dynamically.

- system theme dark theme light theme like on [here](https://alexworradandrews.com/)
- test with jest while learning - see last section of front end roadmap
- some animations? Look into cool things to do with Astro transitions etc.
