# To do list

##Â Blog

- see ideas in [drafts folder](src/pages/blog/_drafts)
- improve design

## Header

- mobile look - do it as full page, tbh could just open new menu page when it's on mobile, scrollable like on wired.com mobile site.

## Accessibility

- use audit thing in dev environment , make edits it suggests particularly for accessibility.
- use lighthouse and make suggested edits.

- add git and github to tools, add hover over names like on [this site](https://ianreve.com/#Projects). also separate section for photoshop and illustrator.

- edit 404 page
- system theme dark theme light theme like on [here](https://alexworradandrews.com/)
- add scroll to top/back to top back into footer.
- edit header so orange for selected header item.
- update portfolio images on codingContent page.
- Maybe put text under technologies used for what they are.
- some animations? Look into cool things to do with Astro transitions etc.
  - maybe bring back typing text on first page
- rebuild form with a backend/using express js, node or such, or netlify.
- Add hero icons/font awesome icons for header hamburger: https://heroicons.dev/?search=x.
- pelicula - present like this: https://tosche.net/fonts/dossier
- test with jest while learning - see last section of front end roadmap
- speech bubble on opening page, scribbled in maybe
- accesibility improved reccommended by MDN:

  - Make clickable bits of header accessible on keyboard: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Keyboard?utm_source=devtools&utm_medium=a11y-panel-checks-keyboard#clickable_elements_must_be_focusable_and_should_have_interactive_semantics
  - add icons for tech stack [like on this one](https://www.jackherizsmith.com/#projCaf), technologies you know. Is better to have more visual. Put [icons from technology on here](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)

## Project structure

- Add project structure like this to Readme:
  i think there's a github repo for generating these somewhere.

  ## ðŸš€ Project Structure

  The project is built of the following files and folders:

  ```text
  /
  â”œâ”€â”€ public/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
  â”œâ”€â”€ src/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/

Keep going with Astro tutorial from [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/6-islands/)

- (later) follow tutorial [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/5-astro-api/2/) on making tag pages for blog. Good for learning about dynamic routing and getstaticpaths() too
