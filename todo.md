## Blogroll

- Skip to "blogs" | "podcasts" |" other sites" at top of wander page, linked through ids.

## Coding

- Blogpost for each project and link to read more button
  - change pub date to project finish date from github
  - add a little bit about what new things you learnt or what was challenging for each project - make it a mini version of readme in github tbh. There's space to add this on the main page in description.
  - Each project opens own page.
  - Include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
  - tbh this could just be a quick blogpost, and then link to it. Would solve issue of filling blog too.

## Colours check

- Check to see if colours in all pages fit: bg-neutral-100 text-neutral-900 dark:bg-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-100 . In most cases the lighter colours will need to be made lighter.

- also get rid of gray text throughout and black text?

##Â Design page

- blog post for each design
  - page for each design
  - For the design work include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
  - Use as inspo to improve how design page looks: [Pentagram](https://www.pentagram.com/) and [MOMA](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5657s)
  - like rey portfolio
- pelicula - present like this: https://tosche.net/fonts/dossier

- make the design page more material design like the coding page.
- pelicula change background colour so stands out from rest of site
- Safe sick pay poster first
