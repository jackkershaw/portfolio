## Blogroll

- add more blogs

## Coding

- Blogpost for each project and link to read more button
  - change pub date to project finish date from github
  - add a little bit about what new things you learnt or what was challenging for each project - make it a mini version of readme in github tbh. There's space to add this on the main page in description.
  - Each project opens own page.
  - Include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
  - tbh this could just be a quick blogpost, and then link to it. Would solve issue of filling blog too.

## sitewide design changes

- Check to see if colours in all pages fit: bg-neutral-100 text-neutral-900 dark:bg-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-100 . In most cases the lighter colours will need to be made lighter.

  - page for each design
  - For the design work include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
