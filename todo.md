## Coding

- add a little bit about what new things you learnt or what was challenging for each project - make it a mini version of readme in github tbh. There's space to add this on the main page in description.
- Each project opens own page - like with design page, use a component layout to get it consistent.
  - Include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
  - tbh this could just be a quick blogpost, and then link to it. Would solve issue of filling blog too.

## sitewide design changes

- Check to see if colours in all pages fit: bg-neutral-100 text-neutral-900 dark:bg-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-100 . In most cases the lighter colours will need to be made lighter.
