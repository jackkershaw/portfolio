## to do first

- [Wander | James' Coffee Blog](https://jamesg.blog/wander/) add wander page as alternative to blogroll and podroll page

## home page

- make better call to action on page like contact ...(like on [Learn UI/UX Design at DesignCourse](https://designcourse.com/coaching))
- move tech stack to within coding element

## New colour scheme

- tbh the whole site could do with a do-over, in terms of colours and style.
- Set hover:text-ykb on all a elements, don't use hover underline. hover:text-ykbdark if in footer or header
- Check to see if colours in all pages fit: bg-neutral-100 text-neutral-900 dark:bg-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-100 . In most cases the lighter colours will need to be made lighter.

## Coding

- add puppeteer to get images dynamically rather than screenshotting manually.
- add vital signs and right to city
- redo the design of this page to be something [like this](https://www.emnuel.xyz/)
- Fix layout so don't have to scroll down so much
- Each project opens own page - like with design page, use a component layout to get it consistent.
- add a little bit about what new things you learnt or what was challenging for each project - make it a mini version of readme in github tbh.
- For the coding projects include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
- update portfolio images - maybe use puppeteer to get this done dynamically.
- fix images, tbh should be able to autogenerate these with puppeteer or such, at least something in build stage. look into.

## Sitewide

- Add some animations! Look into cool things to do with Astro transitions etc.
  - framer motion or gsap too
  - css animations site that used with daily challenges site.
  - animations like on vital signs
- Use Dribble, and other inspiration sites to copy good design
- check site design across mobile.

some portfolio examples for inspiration: https://www.are.na/jack-kershaw/portfolio-khzymlhkihk

## contact form

- Fix so it sends to an api with axios instead of using submitform.

## Design

- Lay out each design on a page when click on it.
- For the design work include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
- Use as inspo to improve how design page looks: [Pentagram](https://www.pentagram.com/) and [MOMA](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5657s)
- pelicula - present like this: https://tosche.net/fonts/dossier

## Accessibility

- use audit thing in dev environment , make edits it suggests particularly for accessibility.
- use lighthouse and make suggested edits.

## Blog

- Write Blog Posts, see ideas in [drafts folder](src/pages/blog/_drafts) and todoist.
- Maybe add mailing list as alt to rss - use buttondown.
- Add follow along buttons like on [this site](https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-simone-silvestroni) at the bottom of each post.

- Good send me message thing on blog [Oh Hello Ana](https://ohhelloana.blog/i-want-it-all/)
