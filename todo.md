## Blog

- Add blog posts:
  - Condense readmes for each project, then can be link to blogpost to read more, as well as github.
  - See ideas in [drafts folder](_drafts) and Todoist.

## Styling

- Use dribble, and other inspiration site to copy a design fairly closely

- A defined style guide would help. Colour scheme - add a secondary colour

## Opening Page

- Add condensed tech stack to front page, like Tim Stanton has.

## Coding

- Edit main photo for each project

  - Gif/video navigating site or interesting photo
  - Improve alt text, add alt text field to json.
  - Carousel within each image, like the three dot thing and swipe between them - probably this rather than the gif things
    -edit description and photo for pluto/octopus. Match description on CV.

- Improve project readmes

  - Include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes, feedback collection etc.

- Under the image for each project, could have icons for the technologies used maybe.

##Â Design page

- Make the design page more aligned with Material Design principles like the coding page
- blog post for each design or same thing as coding

  - include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
  - Use as inspo to improve how design page looks: [Pentagram](https://www.pentagram.com/) and [MOMA](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5657s)

## Metadata

- Create Open Graph meta tags for blog posts - look into best way to do this with astro. Look into how to add images to blogposts maybe.
- Check got enough metadata in general.

## Blog

fix wander page - Blogs and resource recommendations, like the "Wander" section, are thoughtful but could integrate more prominently into the site's theme. For example, labeling them as "Inspiration" or "Learnings" might give a clearer purposeâ€‹
