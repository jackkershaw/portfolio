## Styling

The color scheme and typography are clean but could align more cohesively with the personal branding. A defined style guide would help.

- generally improve layout

## Opening Page

- Add condensed tech stack to front page, like Tim Stanton has.

## Coding

- Edit main photo for each project

  - Gif/video navigating site or interesting photo
  - Improve alt text, add alt text field to json.
  - Carousel within each image, like the three dot thing and swipe between them - probably this rather than the gif things
    -edit description and photo for pluto/octopus. Match description on CV.

- Improve project readmes

  - Include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes, feedback collection etc.

- Under the image for each project, could have icons for the technologies used maybe.

##Â Design page

- optimise for mobile like coding page - smaller text on mobile etc.
- Make the design page more aligned with Material Design principles like the coding page
- boxes in blue instead of black
- blog post for each design or same thing as coding

  - include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
  - Use as inspo to improve how design page looks: [Pentagram](https://www.pentagram.com/) and [MOMA](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5657s)
  - like rey portfolio

- pelicula - present like this maybe: https://tosche.net/fonts/dossier
- Safe sick pay poster first

## Accessibility

- use unlighthouse and make suggested edits.

## Metadata

- Create Open Graph meta tags for blog posts - look into best way to do this with astro. Look into how to add images to blogposts maybe.
- Check got enough metadata in general.

## Contact page

- Fix so it sends an email via [webhook](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41144227)
- improve contact page

##Â Homepage

- make like linkedin front page / about bit - write about Kraken Hackathon, design work etc.
- should probably just have see recent work in big letters and not contact me
- download cv button.

## Blog post

- add blog posts, maybe just condense readmes for each project like Tim did.
- share under blog post should be left aligned
- [shouldn't be such a mess of links, should use social icons etc. ](http://localhost:4321/blog/welcome)

## Blog

Write Blog Posts, see ideas in [drafts folder](_drafts) and todoist.

Use dribble, and other inspiration site to copy a design fairly closely
Colour scheme - add a secondary colour

fix wander page - Blogs and resource recommendations, like the "Wander" section, are thoughtful but could integrate more prominently into the site's theme. For example, labeling them as "Inspiration" or "Learnings" might give a clearer purposeâ€‹
