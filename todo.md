remove portfolio as one of projects

add vital signs and right to city

Move from Astro to NextJS and use [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkGjob3q2GI&t=18548s) for tips.

remove layout shift from portfolio menu on mobile

## New colour scheme

Keep refining the colour scheme

Set hover:text-ykb on all a elements, don't use hover underline. hover:text-ykbdark if in footer or header

Check to see if colours in all pages fit: bg-neutral-100 text-neutral-900 dark:bg-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-100 . In most cases the lighter colours will need to be made lighter.

Add to readme:
I moved to a more neutral colour scheme with ykb blue just used for accents rather than the whole site.
bg-neutral-100 text-neutral-900 dark:bg-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-100

## Coding

- redo the design of this page to be something [like this](https://www.emnuel.xyz/)
- Fix layout so don't have to scroll down so much
- Each project opens own page - like with design page, use a component layout to get it consistent.
- add a little bit about what new things you learnt or what was challenging for each project - make it a mini version of readme in github tbh.
- For the coding projects include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
- update portfolio images - maybe use puppeteer to get this done dynamically.
- fix images, tbh should be able to autogenerate these with puppeteer or such, at least something in build stage. look into.

## Sitewide

- Add some animations! Look into cool things to do with Astro transitions etc.
  - framer motion or gsap too
  - css animations site that used with daily challenges site.
- Use Dribble, and other inspiration sites to copy good design
- Unprofessional, needs to be polished
- check site design across mobile.

## Design

- Add links for guardian, vice, it's nice that.
- Lay out each design on a page when click on it.

## Accessibility

- use audit thing in dev environment , make edits it suggests particularly for accessibility.
- use lighthouse and make suggested edits.
- Make clickable bits of header accessible on keyboard: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Keyboard?utm_source=devtools&utm_medium=a11y-panel-checks-keyboard#clickable_elements_must_be_focusable_and_should_have_interactive_semantics

## Blog
