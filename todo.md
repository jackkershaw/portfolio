  - change pub date to project finish date from github
  - add a little bit about what new things you learnt or what was challenging for each project - make it a mini version of readme in github tbh. There's space to add this on the main page in description.
  - Each project opens own page.
  - Include some process images ie research, early sketches, prototypes , feedback collection etc.
